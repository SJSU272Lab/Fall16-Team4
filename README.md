Horo – A Unique Learning Platform for The Homeless
(horo means training in African language)
Abstract - 
There are over half a million people in USA who are homeless. And There are many more families which are living below the poverty line. We believe that Lack of professional skills and dearth of employment opportunities are two major reasons for this situation.  Though there are different online platforms like udemy, courseera, treehouse etc. which provide free and paid training online, most of the times, it is not accessible to the homeless people and poor families. This is majorly due to the lack of resources and money required to participate in the training courses. 
Enter ‘Horo’! 
‘Horo’ is a unique learning platform specially developed for homeless people and poor families to help them learn new industrial skills, get jobs and recover from their situation. We try to achieve this by connecting three types of people – 
1.	Homeless people / poor families 
2.	People who have industrial skills with experience in their fields and are willing to teach / coach other people
3.	NGOs / non-profit organizations – are the organizations which are working for welfare of homeless people and poor families, are willing to provide logistics and infrastructure to conduct trainings and classes
Apart from this, every participant will be given a ‘certificate of accomplishment’ at the end of the course, which he can use to get a job. Additionally, qualified people will be introduced to different job opportunities available in the vicinity. 
Main features of the platform will be – 
1.	Sign up as a student / trainer or coach / NGO
2.	Search upcoming courses / batches
3.	Rate a trainer / coach
4.	Search available locations for classes
5.	Search for job opportunities in the area
